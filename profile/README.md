## ü§ó&nbsp; Welcome to The NeoBASIC Project

Hi, my name is [Raul Bras](https://github.com/teknolista). I'm a software engineer from üáßüá∑ Brazil and the creator of üî∞ **NeoBASIC** ‚Äî a next generation, multipurpose programming language that transpiles to **C++**. NeoBASIC is designed to help beginners learn programming more easily, while also providing the tools to build reliable, efficient, and high-performance software.

The first draft of the language grammar is ready ([neo-grammar](https://github.com/neobasic/neo-grammar)), and now I'm starting to program the parser ([ngne](https://github.com/neobasic/ngne)), using [Antlr4](https://www.antlr.org/). Everything will be coded in C++. I'm also preparing the website ([www.neobasic.org](https://www.neobasic.org/)), writing the documentation ([en.neobasic.org](https://en.neobasic.org/)), and translating everything from Portuguese ([pt.neobasic.org](https://pt.neobasic.org/)). I also plan to release a VS Code extension, but for now I'm still creating syntax highlighting using TextMate's grammar ([vscode-neo](https://github.com/neobasic/vscode-neo)). It's not an easy task, and I expect it to be a years-long project.

## üë®‚Äçüç≥&nbsp; Anyone Can Code (and Cook)

The phrase of the banner above is a paraphrase of Gusteau's quote "Anyone can cook" from the film "[Ratatouille](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratatouille_(film))." Chef Gusteau's famous quote highlights that talent can emerge in anyone, regardless of background or social status. The film also highlights the importance of following your dreams, the need for persistence and hard work, and the ability to overcome prejudices and social barriers.

## ü¶Å&nbsp; Zeca, The NeoBASIC Mascot

The NeoBASIC mascot is the [chimera](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chimera_(creature)), a mythological creature that emerged in Greece during the 7th century BC. The chimera is characterized by a hybrid appearance of two or more animals (lion, goat, serpent, eagle) and the ability to breathe fire from its nostrils.

The name ZECA is an acronym for "Zero Effort and Cost Abstractions." NeoBASIC is a language based on the concept of "zero-cost abstraction," where features or abstractions are provided without imposing any performance overhead at runtime. The abstractions provided by NeoBASIC are compile-time constructs and do not add any additional cost to the final C++ code, making it as fast as if you had written the code in C++ without the abstractions.

The [chimera icons](https://www.flaticon.com/free-icon/chimera_477118) used in the NeoBASIC project were designed by [Freepik](https://www.flaticon.com/authors/freepik) and sourced from [Flaticon](https://www.flaticon.com/).

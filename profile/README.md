## ü§ó&nbsp; Welcome to The NeoBASIC Project

Hi, my name is [Raul Bras](https://github.com/teknolista). I'm a software engineer from üáßüá∑ Brazil and the creator of üî∞ **NeoBASIC** ‚Äî a next generation, multipurpose programming language that transpiles to **C++**. NeoBASIC is designed to help beginners learn programming more easily, while also providing the tools to build reliable, efficient, and high-performance software.

The first draft of the language grammar is ready ([neob-grammar](https://github.com/neobasic/neob-grammar)), and now I'm starting to program the parser ([ngne](https://github.com/neobasic/ngne)), using [Antlr4](https://www.antlr.org/). Everything will be coded in C++. I'm also preparing the website ([www.neobasic.org](https://www.neobasic.org/en/)), writing the documentation ([en.neobasic.org](https://en.neobasic.org/)), and translating everything from Portuguese ([pt.neobasic.org](https://pt.neobasic.org/)). I also plan to release a VS Code extension, but for now I'm still creating syntax highlighting using TextMate's grammar ([vscode-neob](https://github.com/neobasic/vscode-neob)). It's not an easy task, and I expect it to be a years-long project.

## üî∞&nbsp; Born of Desire, Shaped by Practicality

The NeoBASIC language was born from a desire to help ordinary people to learn how to code.

## ‚úä&nbsp; The Power Of C++ To The People

NeoBASIC code is transpiled into C++, a powerful language that combines high performance, low-level hardware control, and modern object-oriented, generic, and functional programming features, enabling the construction of complex, efficient, and reusable systems. Its ability to directly manipulate memory, combined with a rich standard library and support for high-level abstractions, makes it ideal for both real-time applications (such as games, operating systems, and graphics engines) and high-performance software and embedded systems.

> C++ makes it harder, but when you do it blows your whole leg off.‚Äù

By being transpiled to C++, NeoBASIC retains the performance and ecosystem of the language while adding safety mechanisms that prevent common memory management errors, such as leaks, dangling pointers, or out-of-bounds access. These features not only drastically reduce the risk of critical failures but also allow developers to focus on application logic, taking advantage of the original language‚Äôs strengths without falling into its most dangerous pitfalls. Additionally, NeoBASIC provides modern abstractions and compile-time checks that make code safer, more readable, and more reliable.

## üíñ&nbsp; Open Source, Open Contribution, Open Mind, Open Heart

NeoBASIC was born as a programming language offered to the world as a gift to humanity, a creative gesture that isn't tied to owners or corporations, but expresses itself as a free path for anyone who wishes to embark on the journey of computer programming. This means you can freely learn, practice, and create software with this language, exploring its possibilities and expanding its ecosystem. By using it, you become part of a community that shares knowledge and contributes to the growth and benefit of this language.

## üë®‚Äçüç≥&nbsp; Anyone Can Code (and Cook)

The phrase of the banner above is a paraphrase of Gusteau's quote "Anyone can cook" from the film "[Ratatouille](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratatouille_(film))." Chef Gusteau's famous quote highlights that talent can emerge in anyone, regardless of background or social status. The film also highlights the importance of following your dreams, the need for persistence and hard work, and the ability to overcome prejudices and social barriers.

## ü¶Å&nbsp; Zeca, The NeoBASIC Mascot

The NeoBASIC mascot is the [chimera](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chimera_(creature)), a mythological creature that emerged in Greece during the 7th century BC. The chimera is characterized by a hybrid appearance of two or more animals (lion, goat, serpent, eagle) and the ability to breathe fire from its nostrils.

The name ZECA is an acronym for "Zero Effort and Cost Abstractions." NeoBASIC is a language based on the concepts of *zero-cost abstraction*, and *zero cognitive effort*, in which the resources and abstractions provided are easy to assimilate and do not impose any performance overhead at runtime. The abstractions provided by NeoBASIC are compile-time constructs and do not add any additional cost to the final C++ code, making it as fast as if you had written the code in C++ without the abstractions.

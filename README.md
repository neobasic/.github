Default organization files for the United Sapiens initiative on GitHub.


## How To Include New Translation

To create a new version of the "Organization Overview" content, translated into your country's official language, create a new file **README_xx.md** in the *.github/profile* repository, using UTF-8 encoding. The contents of the file must follow the same conventions adopted in existing files. Preferably, use the [**ISO 639-1 Language Code**](https://www.w3schools.com/tags/ref_language_codes.asp) of your language (2 letters in lowercase).
